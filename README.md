 # Machine Learning Project using Python 


 ## The objective is to use the energy data to build a model that can predict the Energy Star Score of a building and interpret the results to find the factors which influence the score.

 ## General machine learning workflow step-by-step
    - Data cleaning and formatting
    - Exploratory data analysis
    - Feature engineering and selection
    - Compare several machine learning models on a performance metric
    - Perform hyper-parameter tuning on the best model
    - Evaluate the best model on the testing set
    - Interpret the model results
    - Draw conclusions and document work
