# Machine Learning Project using Python 

## General machine learning workflow step-by-step
   - Data cleaning and formatting
   - Exploratory data analysis
   - Feature engineering and selection
   - Compare several machine learning models on a performance metric
   - Perform hyper-parameter tuning on the best model
   - Evaluate the best model on the testing set
   - Interpret the model results
   - Draw conclusions and document work

# Problem Definition
   In this project, we will work with publicly available building energy data from New York City.
   The objective is to use the energy data to build a model that can predict the Energy Star Score of a building and interpret the results to find the factors which influence the score.
   The data includes the Energy Star Score, which makes this a supervised regression machine learning task:
   - `Supervised:` we have access to both the features and the target and our goal is to train a model that can learn a mapping between the two.
   - `Regression:` The Energy Star score is a continuous variable
